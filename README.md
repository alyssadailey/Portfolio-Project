# <#Portfolio-Project>

## Description
Welcome to my Netflix-Inspired Portfolio Website, a dynamic and immersive way to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a full-stack developer. This site is designed to provide an engaging, interactive experience that mirrors the sleek and familiar aesthetic of Netflix.

Built using React, Bootstrap, and reusable components, the site delivers smooth transitions, eye-catching animations, and a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:
🎬 Cinematic Entry: The homepage greets visitors with my name in the iconic Netflix font. A single click anywhere on the screen triggers the signature Netflix login sound and animation, setting the stage for an immersive experience.

👤 Who’s Watching? Just like Netflix, users are then presented with a profile selection page, allowing them to choose their viewer type (e.g., Recruiter, Developer, Friend, Stranger). Each profile leads to a customized experience tailored to the selected user.

📺 Personalized Experience: Upon selection, users land on my About Me page, designed to resemble Netflix’s UI while providing insight into my background, skills, and journey as a developer. A custom navigation bar allows seamless access to other sections of the site.

🚀 Explore More: The portfolio includes sections highlighting my projects, resume, and contact form, all designed with a clean, professional look while maintaining the Netflix-inspired theme.

This project reflects my ability to create visually stunning, interactive, and user-friendly web applications while utilizing modern web technologies. Dive in and explore my world through the lens of Netflix!
